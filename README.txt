Hello there! Welcome to the world of pokémon! My name is Oak! People call me the pokémon Prof! This world is inhabited by creatures called pokémon! For some people, pokémon are pets. Others use them for fights. Myself...I study pokémon as a profession.

In this demo I have provided a brief simulation on what a full pokemon game is like.

You can pick your teammate, and fight your way through the terrain. 

Try walking around using the arrows. When prompted select actions with the A key. You can restart the demo at any time using the SELECT key.
